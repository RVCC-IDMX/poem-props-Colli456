        Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,
        <br>
        The angels, whispering to one another,
        <br>
        Can find, among their burning terms of love,
        <br>
        None so devotional as that of "Mother,"
        <br>
        Therefore by that dear name I long have called you-
        <br>
        You who are more than mother unto me,
        <br>
        And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you
        <br>
        In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
        <br>
        My mother- my own mother, who died early,
        <br>
        Was but the mother of myself; but you
        <br>
        Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
        <br>
        And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
        <br>
        By that infinity with which my wife
        <br>
        Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.
